Proposal
========

List of various points, not necessarily in order, that I should address in my proposal

* Event Selection: Topologies and why the "Maximal Topology" needs to be used
* Organize proposal as (perhaps driven by how an Experimentalist, if observed at work, will be asked, due to the nature of his typical activities, "What are you measuring ?"):
	*   __What__ _I am_ __measuring__
	*   __Why__ _I am_ __measuring__
	*   __How__ _I am_ __measuring__
