Here I keep track of how my extraction of the Integrated Cross-section is coming along.

[12-02-13]The story so far is that, although the shape of my Cross-sections look accetable, they are factor of ~4 smaller than Evgeny's. The factors that could be affecting this, that I have so far identified are:

1. Fiducial Cuts for hadrons are not applied
1. Acceptance may currently be overestimated (for details see notes-simulation)
