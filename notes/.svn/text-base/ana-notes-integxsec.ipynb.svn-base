      "- 08-02-13:\n",
      "    - As I was setting up to investigate this effect, I realized my machinery was too heavy; I am carrying around all topologies (5: top0=(top1+top2+top3+top4), top1, top2, top3, top4) and each has 3 sets of variables (Varsets).I am not even using all of the Tops and Varsets therein currently. This excess baggage is really making ProcEvt2Pi very sluggish and high on resources.  \n",
      "    - Also after talking with Gothe, I feel like I need to start extracting polarization observables, even if the absolute cross section I obtain is still below Evgeny's. This is more in line with the spirit of the presentation I will make in DNP13.\n",

      "        &rarr; I think I need to invest a couple of days to reduce the excess baggage so that I may reduce the time it takes to produce the minimum set of observables.\n",
      "- 08-03-13: \n",
      "    - I have made the machinery much lighter; the performance statistics are noted in the Observations sections. \n",
      "    - __The fact that ProcQ2WSel is not applied to sim-data makes absolutely no difference.__ However, for book keeping, the fact that ProcQ2WSel is not applied to sim-data may be problematic, at least while debugging. I could just apply it, since as I concluded that it makes no difference. However, ProcQ2WSel is not auto-configured to pick up the appropriate Q2W range and implementing it, at this stage, I do not find important. I am going to move this matter to the Odds &amp; Ends section \n",
