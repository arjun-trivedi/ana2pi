+ The following truth table is noted from observations for THnSparse created for ana2pi (ST,SR,SA,SC,SH, and ER)
	+ See notebooks in $SUBSTUDIES/study_tchncl_dtls/study_div_THnSparse

+ It is especially important to keep in mind when keeping track of statistics SA which is created during division i.e. SA=SR/ST

+ In this table, the following nomenclature is used:
	+ empty  = empty cell in THnSparse  i.e. bin not accounted by THnSparse::GetNbins()
	+ filled = filled cell in THnSparse i.e. bin accounted for by THnSparse::GetNbins() 
	+ (0), (>0): Bin content, equal to zero and greater than 0 respectively

	ST		SR		SA=SR/ST
1. 	empty		empty		empty  (0)
2.	filled (>0)	empty		empty  (0)
3.	empty		filled (>0)	filled (0)
4. 	filled (>0)	filled (>0)	filled (>0)

+ Note the following division specifics, which are used above, for THnSparse:
	+ empty(0)/empty(0)    =empty(0)
	+ empty(0)/filled(>0)  =empty(0)
	+ filled(>0)/empty(0)  =filled(0)
	+ filled(>0)/filled(>0)=filled(<0)
